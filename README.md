### A clean portfolio template. 

# Sections

- Home
- Education and Certificates
- Projects
- Contact and Resume

# How To Use

- Clone this repository (or fork, then clone your fork :) )
- Run `npm i`
- Check it out using `npm start`

# How Do I Customize

- Replace `homepage` in package.json to your domain name or `https://<username>.github.io`
- In `src/portfolio.js` you can add your personal portfolio details.
- In `src/theme.js` you can change the theme colors. You can change between Light and Dark theme with the theme switch on the header.

# How to Deploy

I have used Netlify to host my portfolio. If you want to use GitHub Pages, just run `npm run build` and publish all the files in the `/build` folder to your repository.
